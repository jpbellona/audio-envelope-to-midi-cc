# Audio Envelope Follower to MIDI CC

Convert audio amplitude into MIDI CC messages to send to DAW directly for MIDI mapping control

Created in Max/MSP.
1. Drop a folder of audio files into the menu
2. Load an audio file
3. Start the DAC (speaker icon)
4. Play the audio file (always begins from start of file)
5. Change MIDI CC scaling, CC#, outputs to sync with your DAW.
6. Alter playback length for strict duration control.

To use the stand-alone version, you may download the application (created using Max/MSP), at an external site. GitHub no longer allows large files and limits bandwidth.
